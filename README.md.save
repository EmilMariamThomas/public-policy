# Public Sentiment Analysis

This project is a Streamlit-based web app for analyzing public sentiment.  
It uses a logistic regression model trained on Twitter data.  
TF-IDF vectorization is applied to convert text into numerical features.  
Users can input custom text or choose from sample comments.  
The app classifies text as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.  
Results are displayed with colored sentiment cards for better UX.  
It includes a background image to enhance visual appeal.  
Ideal for analyzing feedback on governance and public policies.
